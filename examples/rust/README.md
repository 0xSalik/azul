# Examples

## `cargo run --release --bin async`

- Shows the use of `Thread` to create a background thread to run a long-running task.
- Note that the window can be resized while the background thread is running
- After the background thread is finished, the UI is updated again to show that the
  thread has finished running. The thread is joined without blocking the UI.

- Shows how function composition can be used to reorganize code for the calculator rows,
  by compositing `numpad_btn` (to render a single button of a calculator) and `render_row`
  (to render a row of buttons)
- Also shows how to handle window-global events (to listen for key input without
  requiring the user to hover or focus over any element).

- Code for this demo is 100% auto-generated by azulc (from the `spreadsheet.xml` file)
- Edit the `spreadsheet.xml` file and recompile with `azulc ./spreadsheet.xml > ./spreadsheed.rs && cargo build --release`
- Demonstrates complex layout

## `cargo run --release --bin table`

- Shows the use of iframes to render infinite data structures
- Note that cells that are not visible are not rendered in the DOM
- The table is scrollable, the `IFrameCallback` is called again after a certain scroll threshold
- Performance demo, performs the layout for about 6000 rectangles

## `cargo run --release --bin widgets`
